    <p><strong>Sir Alan Frisbee</strong> is an enigma of the analog age. He was born in a one-room shack in Raccoon, Kentucky, as his grandmother, Bertha May, led a Sacred Harp chorus around the birthing bed. Alan crowned just as the fuguing tunes reached their crescendo. Music has been a part of his daily life ever since.

At the age of five, Alan won the Cream of Kentucky Holler Yodeling Competition, defeating 40-year-old ten-time champion Rondey "The Throat" McClucky. He remains the youngest winner on record.

In 1975, Alan met <strong>Dan Child</strong>, whose family was traveling with a circus that happened to pass through town. Alan saw Dan playing a steel-string guitar and immediately asked him to start a band. Alan recruited his brother Rick on drums, and <em>The Pelts were born</em>.</p>

    <p>Alan and Dan spent a year shaping their sound—an unlikely fusion of bluegrass, folk, and a raw, new kind of rock and roll. After assembling about thirty minutes of material, they recorded their debut album Pelted in a single take at a local radio station’s bluegrass studio. Eager to be heard, they mailed the tape to anyone who might listen. Rick, whose sideline in low-level drug dealing took him to nearby cities, used his connections in the music scene to quietly pass along copies. One night in Richmond, Virginia, he slipped a tape to the manager of Flo & Eddie. A week later, Alan got a call: if they could pay their way, The Pelts were invited to open for Flo & Eddie in South Bend, Indiana.</p>

    <p>In the mid-'90s, Alan was knighted by the King of the tiny, obscure island nation of *Marzipan* (located somewhere in the South Pacific, but no one can quite agree on where). The King, a fan of Alan's music, declared him "Sir Alan Frisbee" in a lavish, yet private ceremony — reportedly, it involved a lot of fireworks and one large goat. Alan has worn the title ever since, though no official records exist, and most historians agree it was an unorthodox honor.</p>

    <p>Alan claims to be the first man to sing falsetto in a rock context — a claim not widely verified, but fiercely defended. He also insists he invented the "dudun" guitar line in *Jack & Diane* while sitting in on a session with John Mellencamp, though no tapes confirm this.</p>

    <p>Alan does not use computers. This site was originally built by second cousin Tom Diskiss, a fan and reluctant webmaster, who only agreed to hand over the domain after Alan showed up to a family reunion in 2004. Tom still updates the site today, under Alan's supervision — which is mostly done by fax.</p>
