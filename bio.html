    <p><strong>Sir Alan Frisbee</strong> is an enigma of the analog age. Born (allegedly) in a one room shack in Racoon, Kentucky, the first sound Alan heard was of Sacred Harp Singing, led by his grandmother, Bertha May, at the moment of his birth. Since then, music has always been a part of Alan's life. As frontman for The Pelts, he helped define and destroy several genres from 1977 to 1981, before vanishing from the public eye — only to re-emerge in the '90s with his solo masterpiece <em>Returns</em>.</p>

    <p>In the mid-'90s, Alan was knighted by the King of the tiny, obscure island nation of *Marzipan* (located somewhere in the South Pacific, but no one can quite agree on where). The King, a fan of Alan's music, declared him "Sir Alan Frisbee" in a lavish, yet private ceremony — reportedly, it involved a lot of fireworks and one large goat. Alan has worn the title ever since, though no official records exist, and most historians agree it was an unorthodox honor.</p>

    <p>Alan claims to be the first man to sing falsetto in a rock context — a claim not widely verified, but fiercely defended. He also insists he invented the "dudun" guitar line in *Jack & Diane* while sitting in on a session with John Mellencamp, though no tapes confirm this.</p>

    <p>Alan does not use computers. This site was originally built by second cousin Tom Diskiss, a fan and reluctant webmaster, who only agreed to hand over the domain after Alan showed up to a family reunion in 2004. Tom still updates the site today, under Alan's supervision — which is mostly done by fax.</p>
